        <h1>Course</h1>
        <p>
          I am pursuing Computer Science as my main course in college, and I chose this course because I am very intrigued by how technology can be so advanced, especially in today's modern era.
        </p>
        
        <h1>IT Experience</h1>
        <p>
          I had little to no experience in the field of IT. Back in 2022, I was still studying as a senior high school student, where I started learning Python, HTML, and CSS. I continued learning coding by myself and through YouTube videos. Over time, I have learned and continue learning as I enter my first year in college.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
        <p>
          My hobbies and interests include taking pictures, playing volleyball and video games, exercising, such as working out, watching anime, and reading Korean manga, which is also known as Manhwa.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Goals in Life/Dream</h1>
        <p>
          My goal in life is to graduate as a cum laude or higher so that I can give back to my parents for all the sacrifices they've made throughout their lives. I also have another goal, which is to become successful so that I can finally reunite with my loved one who is in another country.
