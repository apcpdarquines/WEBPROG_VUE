          <h1>Course</h1>
          <p>
            I am pursuing Computer Science as my main course in college, and I chose this course because I was very
            intrigued by how technology can be so advanced, especially in today's modern era.
          </p>
  
          <h1>IT Experience</h1>
          <p>
            I had little to no experience in the field of IT. Back in 2022, I was still studying as a Senior High School
            student when I started studying Python, HTML, and CSS. I continued to study coding by myself, learning via
            YouTube videos. Over the course of time, I learned and continue to learn as I enter my first year in college up
            until now.
          </p>
  
          <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
          <p>
            My hobbies and interests include taking pictures, playing volleyball, video games, exercising such as working
            out, watching anime, and reading Korean manga, which is also known as Manhwa.
          </p>
  
          <h1>Goals in life/Dream</h1>
          <p>
            My goal in life is to graduate as a cum laude or higher so that I can give back to my parents for what they
            have sacrificed throughout their lives. I also have another goal, which is to become successful so that I could
            finally unite with my loved one who is in another country.
          </p>
